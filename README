This is a simple website health checker for Android. It consists of a widget and a settings page.
Although I have some experience with Android apps using java, this is my first Kotlin app.

The widget shows a green (URL reachable) or red icon (URL not reachable).

Current version (ALPHA):

- URLS + server name on widget are hardcoded.
- Check interval is hardcoded.
- Add as many servers as can fit on the 4 horizontal spaces of the widget.

Future features (P1 - actively under implementation; P4 - later):

- P1 Add an app icon (that shows on the app drawer, currently you have the default)
- P1 URLs + server names can be added on the settings page.
- P1 Check interval can be customized on the settings page.
- P2 Widget contents dynamically adjusts to the amount of servers defined.
- P3 I defined the service icon to show at the top of the screen to indicate that the service is running. For now I can't make it show.
- P3 Notification to be issued when one of the servers is detected down.
- P3 Check ssl certificate dates and warn user when close to the expiry date.
- P4 Setup of cloud server to email a list of emails when a server goes down.
